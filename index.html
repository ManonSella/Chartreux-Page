    <h2>Beware... These fluffy balls will steal your heart forever</h2>
    <p>
      The Chartreux is a rare breed of cat from France, and is recognised by a
      number of registries around the world. The Chartreux is large and muscular
      (called cobby) with relatively short, fine-boned limbs, and very fast
      reflexes. They are known for their blue (silver-grey) water-resistant
      short hair double coats which are often slightly thick in texture (often
      showing "breaks" like a sheepskin) and orange- or copper-coloured eyes.
      Chartreux cats are also known for their "smile"; due to the structure of
      their heads and their tapered muzzles, they often appear to be smiling.
      Chartreux are exceptional hunters and are highly prized by farmers. As for
      every French cat with a pedigree, the first letter of the official name of
      a Chartreux cat encodes the year of its birth.[1] All Chartreux born in
      the same year have official names beginning with the same letter. The code
      letters rotate through the alphabet each year, omitting the letters K, Q,
      W, X, Y, and Z. For example, a Chartreux born in 2021 would have an
      official name starting with the letter S

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The Chartreux is mentioned for the first time in 1558 by Joachim du Bellay
      in a poem entitled "Vers Fran√ßais sur la mort d'un petit chat", or "A
      small kitten's death" in English.[3] There is another representation of a
      Chartreux in 1747 in the Jean-Baptiste Perronneau's painting Magdaleine
      Pinceloup de la Grange, into which the cat is painted as a pet, quite rare
      for the time.[4] There is a legend that the Chartreux are descended from
      cats brought to France by Carthusian monks to live in the order's head
      monastery, the Grande Chartreuse, located in the Chartreuse Mountains
      north of the city of Grenoble (Siegal 1997: p27). But in 1972, the Prior
      of the Grande Chartreuse denied that the monastery's archives held any
      records of the monks' use of any breed of cat resembling the Chartreux.
      Legend also has it that the Chartreux's ancestors were feral mountain cats
      from what is now Syria, brought back to France by returning Crusaders in
      the 13th century, many of whom entered the Carthusian monastic order. The
      first documented mention of the breed was by the French naturalist Buffon
      in the 18th century. The breed was greatly diminished during the first
      World War and wild populations (Helgren 2013: p100‚Äì103) were not seen
      after World War II. A concerted effort by European breeders kept the breed
      from extinction. The first Chartreux were brought to the U.S. in 1971 by
      Helen and John Gamon of La Jolla, California. In 1987, the Cat Fanciers'
      Association (CFA) advanced the Chartreux breed to championship status
      (Siegal 1997: p27). There are fewer than two dozen active Chartreux
      breeders in North America as of 2007.[needs update] Historically, famous
      Chartreux owners include the French novelist Colette, Charles Baudelaire
      and the French president Charles de Gaulle.

    <h2>Temperament</h2>
    <p>
      Chartreux cats tend to be quiet, rarely making noises such as mewing or
      crying, and some are mute. They are quite observant and intelligent, with
      some Chartreux learning to operate radio on/off buttons and to open screen
      door latches. They take about two years to reach adulthood. Chartreux cats
      are playful cats well into their adult years; some can be taught to fetch
      small objects in the same manner as a dog. Chartreux are good with
      children and other animals. They are non-aggressive, affectionate, good
      travelers and generally very healthy. Chartreux tend to bond with one
      person in their household, preferring to be in their general vicinity
      (often following their favoured person from room to room), though they are
      still loving and affectionate to the other members of the household.
